The calculator  takes any number of input by the user from
the console/command line and perform the following operations:
- Take multiple integer values entered by the user, add them and print out the result.
-Take multiple integer values entered by the user, do a subtraction on them in the
order they are entered and print out the result.
-Take multiple integer values entered by the user, multiply them and print out the
result.
- Take only two integer values entered by the user divide the first number by the
second and print out the result. Account for infinite value error (division by zero).
- Take multiple integer values entered by the user and compute their average.
